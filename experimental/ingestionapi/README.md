# Ingestion API

Ingestion API is a REST API and offers two interaction patterns: bulk and streaming. The streaming pattern accepts incremental updates to a dataset as those changes are captured, while the bulk pattern accepts CSV files in cases where data syncs occur periodically. The same data stream can accept data from the streaming and the bulk interaction.
