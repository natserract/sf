# AMP Script
AMPscript is an interpreted scripting language for Marketing Cloud Engagement. With AMPscript, you can integrate the data in your customer database with your marketing content. This tight integration enables your Marketing team to send highly personalized messages using all of the communication channels that Marketing Cloud Engagement supports, including email, SMS, and mobile. You can also use it to create customized landing pages and microsites. When you send messages or deploy CloudPages that contain AMPscript, the AMPscript code is executed on the Marketing Cloud Engagement server when the message is sent or when the landing page loads.
