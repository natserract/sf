# Pub/Sub API

Pub/Sub API provides a single interface for publishing and subscribing to platform events, including real-time event monitoring events, and change data capture events. Based on [gRPC API](https://grpc.io/docs/) and HTTP/2, Pub/Sub API efficiently publishes and delivers binary event messages in the Apache Avro format.
